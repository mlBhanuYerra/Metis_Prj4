Losing means certain death.The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence.

Questa verità è cosí radicata nella mente delle famiglie del luoho che, nel momento in cui un simile personaggio viene a far parte del vicinato, prima ancora di conoscere anche lontanamente i suoi desiderî in proposito, viene immediatamente considerato come proprietà legittima di una o l'altra delle loro figlie.»Orgoglio e pregiudizio è uno dei primi romanzi di Jane Austen. La scrittrice lo iniziò a ventun anni; il libro, rifiutato da un editore londinese, rimase in un cassetto fino alla sua pubblicazione anonima nel 1813, e da allora è considerato tra i piú importanti romanzi della letteratura inglese. È la storia delle cinque sorelle Bennet e dei loro corteggiatori, con al centro il romantico contrasto tra l'adorabile e capricciosa Elizabeth e l'altezzoso Darcy; lo spirito di osservazione implacabile e quasi cinico, lo studio arguto dei caratteri, la satira delle vanità e delle debolezze della vita domestica, fanno di questo romanzo una delle piú efficaci e indimenticabili commedie di costume del periodo Regency inglese.\",\"Modern Library Classics, USA / CAN\",Paperback,9.78068E+12,279 pages,4.25,2453620,54322,Pride and Prejudice,Classics|Fiction|Romance,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320399351l/1885.jpg\n",

The book that has it all is The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia.For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature.

      "Oscar Wilde|Jeffrey Eugenides,\"﻿Written in his distinctively dazzling manner, Oscar Wilde’s story of a fashionable young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty is the author’s most popular work. The tale of Dorian Gray’s moral disintegration caused a scandal when it ﬁrst appeared in 1890, but though Wilde was attacked for the novel’s corrupting inﬂuence, he responded that there is, in fact, “a terrible moral in Dorian Gray.” Just a few years later, the book and the aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials occasioned by Wilde’s homosexual liaisons, which resulted in his imprisonment. Of Dorian Gray’s relationship to autobiography, Wilde noted in a letter, “Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps.”\",Modern Library Classics,Paperback,9.78038E+12,367 pages,4.06,775701,22938,The Picture of Dorian Gray,Fiction|Classics|Horror|Fantasy|Literature|Gothic|Novels|Literature|19th Century|Classics|Classic Literature|European Literature|British Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1424596966l/5297.jpg\n",

      "Victor Hugo|Lee Fahnestock|Norman MacAfee,\"Introducing one of the most famous characters in literature, Jean Valjean—the noble peasant imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread—Les Misérables ranks among the greatest novels of all time. In it, Victor Hugo takes readers deep into the Parisian underworld, immerses them in a battle between good and evil, and carries them to the barricades during the uprising of 1832 with a breathtaking realism that is unsurpassed in modern prose. Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Thénardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds. Les Misérables gave Victor Hugo a canvas upon which he portrayed his criticism of the French political and judicial systems, but the portrait that resulted is larger than life, epic in scope—an extravagant spectacle that dazzles the senses even as it touches the heart.\",,Mass Market Paperback,9.78045E+12,1463 pages,4.15,591874,13063,Les Misérables,Classics|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1525303092l/24280.jpg\n",

       "\"You can find the redesigned cover of this edition HERE.This best-selling Norton Critical Edition is based on the 1847 first edition of the novel. For the Fourth Edition, the editor has collated the 1847 text with several modern editions and has corrected a number of variants, including accidentals. The text is accompanied by entirely new explanitory annotations.New to the fourth Edition are twelve of Emily Bronte's letters regarding the publication of the 1847 edition of Wuthering Heights as well as the evolution of the 1850 edition, prose and poetry selections by the author, four reviews of the novel, and poetry selections by the author, four reviews of the novel, and Edward Chitham's insightful and unformative chronology of the creative process behind the beloved work.Five major critical interpretations of Wuthering Heights are included, three of them new to the Fourth Edition. A Stuart Daley considers teh mimportance of chronology in the novel. J. Hillis Miller examines Wuthering Heights's problems of genre and critical reputation. Sandra M. Gilbert asseses the role of Victorian Christianity plays in the novel, while Martha Nussbaum traces the novel's romanticism. Finally, Lin Haire-Sargeant scrutinizes the role of Heathcliff in film adaptations of Wuthering Heights. A Chronology and updated Selected Bibliography are also included.(back cover)\""
